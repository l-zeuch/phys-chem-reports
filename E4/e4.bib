Activation energies of diffusion, Ea,D are calculated for both redox species in each system. Diffusion coefficient ratios of the diffusion coefficients of Fc compared to that of Fc+ in each case were found to be very close to 1. Activation energies of diffusion, Ea,D, for ferrocene and ferrocenium in the acetonitrile/perchlorate system were determined as 6.5 (±0.2) and 7.2 (±0.5)kJmol−1, respectively. Similar values were determined for the acetonitrile/hexafluorophosphate system: 7.1 (±0.1)kJmol−1 for Fc and 7.4 (±0.3)kJ mol−1 for Fc+. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded for ferrocene oxidation in both acetonitrile/electrolyte systems and it was observed that the E12 values were similar and independent of the electrolyte used.}
