% This file contains custom hyphenation rules for LaTeX documents.

% TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
% When LaTeX encounters the end of a line, it first tries its best to properly fill that line. Read on kerning and font expansion as well as Knuth's algorithm if you care about that.
% If it cannot do that without absolutely disgusting results, it hyphenates the word.
% Now, if LaTeX cannot find any rules about how to hyphenate said word, it just gives up and doesn't, and/or guesses based on some other fancy pants code where a hyphen *probably* goes.
% This usually results in that insanely annoying "overfull hbox" warning.
% Microtype (which is also included in this document's preamble) can already do a lot of magic. And I mean magic.
% However, in really rare circumstances, even that might not work out, though much less and much smaller overfull, something like 2-7 pixels.
% Barely noticeable, still quite an annoying warning.
% Although the base dictionaries have a lot of hyphenation already present, some rare, or specialised words may not exist in there.

% Of course, one could always use the in-text notation of hy\-phe\-na\-tion, but that tends to become really annoying when you're using it a bunch of times.
% Or if it's a long word, like su\-per\-ca\-li\-fra\-gil\-is\-tic\-ex\-pi\-a\-li\-do\-ci\-ous, even if only repeated one or two times.

% USAGE
% To add a new hyphenation rule, add it to the below list, ideally (for search efficiency) alphabetically sorted.
% A good initial baseline is to use the general rules of hyphenation (i.e. syllables), however, for readability, you may wish to do it differently.
% LaTeX doesn't care and so long it makes somewhat sense, nobody who'll read your document will notice.
% Now you know why we always clapped in school when saying words :-) That's what that was for, you are welcome.
